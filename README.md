As your assistant, I can certainly provide you with some guidance on how to create an Angular PWA with the features you have mentioned.

Firstly, you will need to ensure that you have the latest version of Angular installed on your system. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Once you have installed Angular, you can create a new project by running the following command:

```
ng new my-project
```

Next, you will need to add the necessary packages for voice-to-text, text-to-chat, chat-to-voice, and machine-vision. There are several packages available for these features, but some popular ones include:

- SpeechRecognition API for voice-to-text
- Dialogflow for text-to-chat and chat-to-voice
- TensorFlow.js for machine-vision

You can install these packages using the following commands:

```
npm install --save @types/web-speech-api
npm install --save @google-cloud/dialogflow
npm install --save @tensorflow/tfjs
```

Once you have installed the necessary packages, you can start building your Angular PWA. You can create a UI/UX that allows users to input voice commands, which will be converted to text using the SpeechRecognition API. This text can then be sent to Dialogflow for chatbot functionality, which can respond with text or even voice through text-to-chat and chat-to-voice features. Additionally, machine-vision can be incorporated into the UI/UX to allow for image recognition capabilities.

To do this, you can create an Angular component that handles the voice-to-text feature using the SpeechRecognition API. Here is an example:

```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'voice-to-text',
  templateUrl: './voice-to-text.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./voice-to-text.component.css']
})

export class VoiceToText {
  recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();

  constructor() {
    this.recognition.continuous = false;
    this.recognition.interimResults = false;
    this.recognition.lang = 'en-US';
  }

  start() {
    this.recognition.start();
    this.recognition.onresult = (event) => {
      let transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
      console.log(transcript);
    }
  }

  stop() {
    this.recognition.stop();
  }
}
```

This component sets up the SpeechRecognition API and listens for voice input.
The transcript of the voice input is then captured and printed to the console.

Next, you can create a component for the chatbot functionality using Dialogflow. Here is an example:

```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { environment } from '../../environments/environment';

declare var apiai: any;

@Component({
  selector: 'text-to-chat',
  templateUrl: './text-to-chat.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./text-to-chat.component.css']
})

export class TextToChat {
  private token: string = environment.dialogflow.token;
  private session: any;
  public messages: any[] = [];

  constructor() {
    this.session = new apiai(this.token, { language: 'en' });
  }

  sendMessage(message: string) {
    let request = this.session.textRequest(message);

    request.on('response', (response) => {
      let speech = response.result.fulfillment.speech;
      this.messages.push({ text: message, sender: 'user' }, { text: speech, sender: 'bot' });
    });

    request.on('error', (error) => {
      console.log(error);
    });

    request.end();
  }
}
```

This component uses the Dialogflow API to process text input from the user and generate a response. The response is then displayed in the UI/UX as a message from the chatbot.

Finally, you can incorporate machine-vision into the UI/UX using TensorFlow.js. Here is an example:

```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'image-recognition',
  templateUrl: './image-recognition.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./image-recognition.component.css']
})

export class ImageRecognition {
  model: any;
  prediction: any;
  file: any;

  constructor() {
    this.loadModel();
  }

  async loadModel() {
    this.model = await tf.loadLayersModel('assets/model.json');
  }

  async predict() {
    let image = new Image();
    image.src = URL.createObjectURL(this.file);

    image.onload = async () => {
      let tensor = await tf.browser.fromPixels(image).resizeNearestNeighbor([224, 224]).toFloat().expandDims();
      let predictions = await this.model.predict(tensor).data();
      this.prediction = predictions;
    };
  }

  handleFileInput(event: any) {
    this.file = event.target.files[0];
  }
}
```
This component loads a pre-trained machine-vision model using TensorFlow.js and allows users to input an image file. The image is then processed by the model, and the prediction is displayed in the UI/UX.

To make this Angular PWA a Digital Intelligence Decentralized Global Governance Technology Demonstrator, you can incorporate blockchain technology into the application. This can be done using a blockchain platform such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric to provide decentralized governance and decision-making capabilities.

Overall, this Angular PWA with voice-to-text, text-to-chat, chat-to-voice, and machine-vision features, along with blockchain technology, can serve as a powerful digital intelligence tool for governance and decision-making in various industries.
